In Twitch Plays Pokémon (TPP), you can bet on and influence matches of **Pokémon Battle Revolution** (PBR) in chat!

You have two currencies:

**Pokéyen** - virtual currency, used to bet on Pokémon matches

**Tokens** - virtual currency, based on stream donations, subscriptions and give-aways.

PBR has four main phases: **Betting Phase, Match Phase, Results Phase** and **Sidegame**
