The number of bits used in Cheers is tracked, for every 100 bits in total cheered (can be from multiple cheers from multiple people) the Cheerful Slots are played.

Cheerful Slots determine prizes which are then distributed to random people in chat.

The possible prizes are:

* Tokens
* Mostly nothing
* Fun stuff
* Uncommon badges
* Rare badges
* Gen 2~7 badges
