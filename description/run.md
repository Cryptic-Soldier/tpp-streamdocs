Twitch Plays Pokemon is a stream that lets you play Pokemon collaboratively with a lot of other people by typing commands into chat.

# Pokémon Theta Emerald EX

Pokémon Theta Emerald EX is a Generation 3 ROM hack that aims to make Pokemon Emerald more like Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire. All 721 species from Generation 6 are present, as are all their moves and abilities. Mega evolution is also included, as well as many other Generation 6 features.

# How to play

You can input commands into chat that control the game being played. 'Up', 'left', 'down', 'right', 'a', 'b', 'start', and 'select' are all valid commands. GBA-based games also have 'l' and 'r', and DS games have 'x', 'y', and touchscreen commands, described below. You can input a single button, or up to 3 buttons (such as 'right+b') which will be pressed simultaneously. You can also hold down a button (or buttons) by adding '-' at the end. The button(s) will be held until the next input, which can continue to hold if it also uses the same button(s). There is a stream delay which results in a delay between when you input a command and when it shows up on the game, as well as a chat delay dictating how quickly you can input commands.

# Using the Touchscreen

If the game is DS or 3DS based, we will have control over the touchscreen. A touchscreen command looks like this: 'xxx,yyy' where 'xxx' is the horizontal location on the screen, and 'yyy' is the vertical location on the screen. We also intend to have names for common buttons on the touchscreen for each run, so that you can simply say 'move1' to hit the first move in battle, for example.

# Democracy

Democracy is a different method of playing the game. While in anarchy (the default method) every input goes directly to the game, in democracy every 30 seconds the most inputted command during that timespan is sent to the game. There are also additional inputs you can use, such as specifying the number of times a button should be pressed (up to 9 per instance), duplicating button inputs in the same chain, and 'wait', which waits for the amount of time an input would take. An example of a democracy command not possible in anarchy is 'wait4baba', which would 'wait' 4 times before pressing 'b', 'a', 'b', 'a', in that order.

Democracy comes in two variations: normal democracy and puzzle democracy. Normal democracy can be activated by going to a specified area in the game, whether it’s a house or a Pokémon center, and voting commences for 3 minutes. By typing in anarchy or democracy, you can vote whether or not you want democracy. If democracy votes are 75% of the votes (only one vote per user, the most recent vote is taken), democracy will commence for a 7-minute period. Afterwards, depending on which area this took place, there will either be another opportunity to vote or a lengthy cooldown before democracy can be used again.

Puzzle democracy however works differently. Certain areas have challenging puzzles, and while is encouraged to be completed in anarchy, but to avoid being stuck for days, a modified version of democracy will be available if enough time has passed. This can be voted on in the same way, and can be used to complete the puzzle. Unlike regular democracy, certain commands are limited, like pressing start, in order to ensure it’s used for the puzzle at hand.
