Commands correspond to the buttons on the console.  Type into the chat box and press Enter to control the game.

Available commands: *up, down, left, right, a, b, start, select, X, Y, L, R*

**Tip:** Commands are not case sensitive - trying mixing it up!

For example, typing *sEleCt* will have the same effect as *select*.
