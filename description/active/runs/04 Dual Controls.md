When playing a dual run, you can specify which game you send your commands to.

Simply type *l:* or *r:* followed by your command.

So, if you wanted to send a Select command to the right game, you would type: *r:select*

* If you don't specify a game, your command will be issued in an alternating sequence to each game.
* Democracy commands cannot be directed to either game.  All commands made in Democracy go to both games at the same time.

**Tip:** You can suppliment the colon for a full stop/period or nothing at all.  You may also use *<* or *>* to specify a game.
