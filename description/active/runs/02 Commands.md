For questions about any */w tpp* command, then use */w tpp help [command]* to be whispered by the bot for more info.

***Note:** All chat commands that display **/w tpp** may also be replaced by using **![command]** in regular chat. This applies for all sections.*

## Available Commands
Valid inputs for this run are:
- *a, b, x, y, l, r, z, start*
- *up, down, left, right, lup, ldown, lleft, lright, cup, cdown, cleft, cright*

## Tips
- Commands are not case sensitive - you can mix it up! For example, *sEleCt* will have the same effect as *select*.
- You can also use cardinal directions in replacement of regular directions: *n, e, s, w*
- Up to 3 buttons can be pressed simultaneously: *b+up+l*
- Inputs ending in *-* are held longer.
- Just want to farm experience to level up (*/w tpp level*)? Use: *exp, xp,* or *p*
