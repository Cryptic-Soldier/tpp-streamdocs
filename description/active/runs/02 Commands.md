For questions about any */w tpp* command, then use */w tpp help [command]* to be whispered by the bot for more info.

***Note:** All chat commands that display **/w tpp** may also be replaced by using **![command]** in regular chat. This applies for all sections.*

## Available Commands
As a touchscreen run on the Nintendo DS, there are many commands available! To see the full list and explanations on these commands, visit [here](https://github.com/TwitchPlaysPokemon/tpp-streamdocs/blob/master/run-commands/volt-white-commands.md).

## Tips
- Commands are not case sensitive - you can mix it up! For example, *sEleCt* will have the same effect as *select*.
- You can also use compass directions in replacement of regular directions: *n, e, s, w*
- Just want to farm experience to level up (*/w tpp level*)? Use: *exp, xp,* or *p*
