For questions about any **!** command, use **!help [command]** to be whispered by the bot for more info. For a full list of commands, type **!commands**. Alternatively, go [here](https://twitchplayspokemon.tv/commands) for an in-depth explanation of all commands available on stream.

## Available Commands
Valid commands for this run are:
- **Button commands**: **A, B, X, Y, L, R, ZL, ZR, Plus, Minus, LStick, RStick**
- **Directional commands**: **Up, Down, Left, Right, DUp, DDown, DLeft, DRight, RUp, RDown, RLeft, RRight**

You can use **LSpinL** or **RSpinL** to to spin counter-clockwise, and **LSpinR** or **RSpinR** to spin clockwise.

## Touchscreen Commands
You can use **>** for coordinates to drag the touchscreen (**0,0>100,100**). Coordinates can be held down (**40,160-**), as well as combining them into to a regular command (**315,50+a**). Touchscreen commands cannot combine with themselves.

## Tips
- Commands are not case sensitive - you can mix it up! For example, **StArT** will have the same effect as **start**.
- You can also use cardinal directions in replacement of regular directions: **n**, **e**, **s**, **w**.
- Up to 3 buttons can be pressed simultaneously: **b+up+l**
- Commands ending in **-** are held longer.
- Just want to farm experience to level up (**!level**)? Use: **exp**, **xp**, or **p**.
