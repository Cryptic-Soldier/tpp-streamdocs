## How To Play

You can pick a team by typing **team !left** or **team !right**, then you can type **up**, **down**, **left**, **right**, **a**, **b**, **start** or **select** to play the game.

You can press up to 3 buttons at the same time by using **+**. Typing **a+b+right** will press the buttons **a**, **b** and **right** at the same time.

You can switch teams whenever you want.

## Tips
- Commands are not case sensitive - you can mix it up! For example, **StArT** will have the same effect as **start**.
- You can also use cardinal directions in replacement of regular directions: **n**, **e**, **s**, **w**.
- Up to 3 buttons can be pressed simultaneously: **b+up+l**
- Commands ending in **-** are held longer.
