## Tips
- Commands are not case sensitive - you can mix it up! For example, *StArT* will have the same effect as *start*.
- You can also use cardinal directions in replacement of regular directions: *n, e, s, w*
- Up to 3 buttons can be pressed simultaneously: *b+up+l*
- Inputs ending in - are held until either one of those buttons is pressed again, or another held input is sent.
- Just want to farm experience to level up (*/w tpp level*)? Use: *exp*, *xp,* or *p*
