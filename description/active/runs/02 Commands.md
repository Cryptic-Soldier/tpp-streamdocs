## Do I have to use the coordinates?

It's not necessary to use coordinates. The coordinates are mostly listed for convenience, you can simply press their respective button to activate the desired command.

## Tips
- Commands are not case sensitive - you can mix it up! For example, **StArT** will have the same effect as **start**.
- You can also use cardinal directions in replacement of regular directions: **n**, **e**, **s**, **w**
- Up to 3 buttons can be pressed simultaneously: **b+up+l**
- Commands ending in **-** are held longer.
- Just want to farm experience to level up (**!level**)? Use: **exp**, **xp**, or **p**
