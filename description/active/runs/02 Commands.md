## How To Play

You can pick a team by typing **!left** or **!right**, then you can type **up**, **down**, **left**, **right**, **a**, **b**, **start** or **select** to play the game.

You can switch teams whenever you want.

## Tips
- Commands are not case sensitive - you can mix it up! For example, **StArT** will have the same effect as **start**.
- You can also use cardinal directions in replacement of regular directions: **n**, **e**, **s**, **w**.
- You can press 2 buttons at the same time by using **+**. Typing **b+right** will press the buttons **b** and **right** at the exact same time.
- You can end your commands with **-** to hold the buttons down for a longer period. Typing **up-** will hold the button **up** for a longer period. You can still press multiple buttons while holding them down for a longer period. This can be useful for taking two steps at once while walking, for example. If inputs are fast enough, sequential button presses with **-** will merge into a single long held press.
- Twitch's automatic anti-spam system will disconnect you from Twitch chat site-wide for up to an hour if you send 20 or more messages in 30 seconds or less. Subscribers can reconnect immediately. If you input a lot, consider subscribing to the channel!
