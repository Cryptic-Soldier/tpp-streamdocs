Currently playing **Pokémon X**.

## Touchscreen Commands
You can use **>** for coordinates to drag the touchscreen (**0,0>100,100**). Aliases and coordinates can be held down (**bag-**, **20,234-**), as well as combining them into to a regular command (**move1+a**, **40,70+a**). Touchscreen commands cannot combine with themselves. The [TPPInputAssist Touchscreen Extension](https://github.com/chfoo/tppinputassist), made by Chfoo, can be used to make tapping in specific places of the screen easier, instead of having to type out the coordinates.

## Tips
- Commands are not case sensitive - you can mix it up! For example, **StArT** will have the same effect as **start**.
- You can also use cardinal directions in replacement of regular directions: **n**, **e**, **s**, **w**.
- Up to 3 buttons can be pressed simultaneously: **b+up+l**
- Commands ending in **-** are held longer.
- Just want to farm experience to level up (**!level**)? Use: **exp**, **xp**, or **p**.
