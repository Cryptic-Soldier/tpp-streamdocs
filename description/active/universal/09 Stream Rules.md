## Botting and scripting

With some exceptions, there is to be no active participation in chat from bots. Passive and reactive botting, such as listening to chat and responding to whispers, is permitted.

Permitted bot behaviours:

* Scraping for information by querying *tpp* and processing the response
* Processing messages said in chat and *#tpp*
* Betting on matches using tokens (**pokeyen betting is not permitted**)
* Trading badges

Otherwise ask for permission first or your bot will be immediately banned.

**Bots are not permitted to use alternate accounts unless permission is given.**
