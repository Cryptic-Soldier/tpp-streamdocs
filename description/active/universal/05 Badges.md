Badges are miniature Pokémon to display next to your name on the stream. Collect them during runs or Pokémon Pinball!

When a Pokémon species is caught in game, its badge will be awarded!
If you've inputted in the last 30 minutes, you'll be eligible to win!
Each species is awarded only once - repeat catches are not awarded!
