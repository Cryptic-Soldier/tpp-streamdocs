## Bit Emotes

Additionally, you can now unlock emotes for cheering. You don't have to cheer 1000 bits in a single message to unlock tppCursor, you can cheer a small quantity per message, and you'll slowly get to the 1000 bits needed to unlock tppCursor. Once unlocked, the emote is yours to keep forever. This rule applies to all Bit Emotes listed below.
