## Bit Badges

By donating **Twitch Bits** to the stream in chat using **Cheer** commands, you can obtain a **Bit Badge** on stream showing what major amount of **Bits** you have donated. [**Here's a list of all Bit Badges available on stream.**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/150179304896987136/739481414809944074/unknown.png)

## Bit Emotes

Additionally, you can now unlock emotes for cheering. You don't have to cheer 1000 bits in a single message to unlock tppCursor, you can cheer a small quantity per message, and you'll slowly get to the 1000 bits needed to unlock tppCursor. Once unlocked, the emote is yours to keep forever. This rule applies to all Bit Emotes listed below.
