Show your lineage!  Your emblem indicates how many runs you've participated in, and the run in which you joined!

* Your emblem has two numbers: *your first run* | *number of runs*
* Input at least once on a run to earn the badge for it
* Your emblem is coloured after your first run, but you can change it

**List your emblems:** */w tpp emblems*  
**Change your emblem colour:** */w tpp selectemblem [run number]*

**Note:** Due to incomplete logs a small percentage of people from the first run did not get their emblem for that run.
