Show your lineage! Your **Emblem** indicates how many **Runs** you've participated in, and the **Run** in which you joined!

- Your Emblem has two numbers: *Your first Run* | *Number of Runs*
- Input at least once on a Run to earn the Emblem for it
- Your Emblem is colored after your first Run, but you can change it

**!emblems**: List your Emblems  
**!selectemblem \[run number\]**: Change your Emblem color

**Note**: Due to incomplete logs a small percentage of people from the first Run did not get their Emblem for that Run.
