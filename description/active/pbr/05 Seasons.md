## Current Season

The current PBR season is the **28th** Season! There is an up to 1.5* multiplier available to the standard bonus, with that multiplier being tied to how much you input during a match. You can get an idea of the size of your input multiplier by seeing the colour of your bonus % during results. Teal is high, while gray is low. Additionally, you can now create an avatar using the [TPP website](https://twitchplayspokemon.tv/avatars). Which, when enabled, will have a chance to appear as your team's representative during a battle.
