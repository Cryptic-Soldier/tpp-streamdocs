## Current Season

The current PBR season is the **33rd** season, a week long season, starting on October 4th at 01:00 UTC, and ending on October 11th 00:00 UTC, then there's another 1 day and 21 hours of **3DS Intermission**, that's happening until the start of the **Randomized Ultra Moon** run, scheduled to start on October 12th at 21:00 UTC! All matches, with the exception of **Token Matches**, are **Defiance** matches. There's an up to 10% bet bonus for all **Defiance** matches. Additionally, you can now create an avatar using the [TPP website](https://twitchplayspokemon.tv/avatars). Which, when enabled, will have a chance to appear as your team's representative during a battle.
