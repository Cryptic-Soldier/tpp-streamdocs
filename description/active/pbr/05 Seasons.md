## Seasons Schedule

* **February 22nd - March 2nd:** Bet bonuses will be capped to 20,000 pokeyen per match, regardless of actual percentage.
* **March 2nd - March 11th:** Bet bonuses will be *severely* nerfed, but uncapped and have no other changes.
* **March 11th:**  We will be going back to Burning Red to complete the remainder of the Sevii Islands post-game as an intermission!
* **After Burning Red - March 22nd:** ***Defiance Doubles Week!*** Using whichever of the first 2 solutions gained the most positive reaction to control bet bonuses. In addition to being a solid block of defiance 4v4 doubles to test your "skills" this week, it should introduce many new fixes and gimmicks to PBR!
* **March 22nd - March 31st:** Instead of bet bonuses, we will be having the tpp and tppsimulator bots placing large bets against each other every match, and using sever bet limits to encourage early betting.
* **April 1st:** ***April Fools!***
* **April 2nd - April 11th:** A second test with the betting bots, only this time instead of strict bet limits, there will be a bonus tied to the profit you win instead of your bet.
* **April 12th:** Intermission before the next run.
* **April 13th:** End of the currently planned PBR seasons, and the beginning of the ***Volt White*** run!
 
***Note:** All timings are subject to change due to potential development issues.*
