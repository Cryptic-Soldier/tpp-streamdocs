## Current Season

* The current PBR season is the **36th** season.
* This season ends December 14th at 21:00 UTC. [Here's a countdown](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20191214T21&p0=1440&msg=Season+36+End&font=cursive&csz=1) so you know when that is in your timezone.
* Yet another Betbots season, TPP and TPPSimulator are betting 2500 on every match regardless of their balance! Yes, they can go in debt!
* This is a Defiance only season, meaning you can bet, but you can't control the outcome of the matches.
* There's an up to 45% bet bonus.
* There is a 1.5* profit bonus available to the standard bonus.
* Additionally, you can now create an avatar using the [TPP website](https://twitchplayspokemon.tv/avatars). Which, when enabled, will have a chance to appear as your team's representative during a battle.
