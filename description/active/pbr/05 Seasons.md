The current PBR season is the **34th** season, a two week long Halloween season, containing very spooky soundtrack, and sets custom tailored for this Halloween season.
This season starts on October 23rd at 13:00 UTC, and pauses on October 31st at 00:00 UTC. This season will be running until our next short intermission, **Trick or Treat House**, then after that, we're back for another week of this Halloween season.
