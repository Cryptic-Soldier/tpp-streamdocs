## Current Season

* The current PBR season is the **52nd** season.
* This is a Defiance only season, meaning you can place bets but you can't influence the outcome of the matches!
* [Renegade Platinum starts on April 10th at 9pm UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20210410T2100&p0=1440&msg=Renegade%20Platinum&font=cursive&csz=1).
* There are no bet bonuses for betting early before a match starts.
* Additionally, you can create up to 6 avatars using the [PBR avatar editor](https://twitchplayspokemon.tv/avatars). After betting on a team, one of your avatars will have a chance to appear as your team's representative during a battle.
