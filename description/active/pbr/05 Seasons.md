## Current Season

* The current PBR season is the **56th** season.
* This is an experimental highscore season. Your place on the leaderboard is determined by your highest amount of Pokéyen earned during the season rather than your current amount.
* Matches can range from 1v1 to 6v6!
* [Randomized Black starts on July 3rd at 9pm UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20210703T2100&p0=1440&msg=Randomized%20Black&font=cursive&csz=1).
* There is a bet bonus for betting early before a match starts.
* Additionally, you can create up to 6 avatars using the [PBR avatar editor](https://twitchplayspokemon.tv/avatars). After betting on a team, one of your avatars will have a chance to appear as your team's representative during a battle.
