Got a match you're dying to see?  Use your tokens and bid for your very own custom battles!  These are played out live on-stream on the hour.

**Bid for a match** by typing: */w tpp match [blue team]/[red team] t[amount]*

During the break, each match will be assigned a codename and displayed on-stream.  If you spot a match you want to see, you can boost it with your own tokens.

**Boost a displayed match** by typing: */w tpp match [codename] t[amount]*

* Choose Pokémon by name or by National Pokédex Number
* Separate each Pokémon with commas
* The match with the most tokens will be played on the hour
* If you are outbid, your tokens will be returned to you 

So, if you were to type */w tpp match omastar,kabutops,aerodactyl/cradily,armaldo,milotic t3*, you would place a 3 token bid on that battle to be played on the hour

## Metasets

Want to add a unique spin on your token match?  Want something more than the default movesets?  Fine-tune your battle with a metaset!

**Select a Metaset** by typing: */w tpp match [metaset] [blue team]/[red team] t[amount]*

Chose from 1 of 10 Metasets for your battle: *adavnced, stadium 2, uber, runmons, luckmons, starters, seismic toss, KAPOW, rough skin, input war*

**Need something specific?** If a metaset has more than one moveset for a Pokémon, you can specify with a dash (*[pokemon]-[moveset],...*)

Find out more about each metaset in the full [**full PBR Guide**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tLIOaxOXgi0zRWlskkAhgyVfUivdrMaYmSIcM0dFVW8/edit#gid=1127521972).
