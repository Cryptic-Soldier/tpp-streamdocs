Got a match you're dying to see?  Use your tokens to bid for your very own custom matches!  These are played out live on-stream on the hour.

Whisper "match help" to tpp for a mini-tutorial on token match bidding.

For example, type */w tpp match omastar,kabutops,aerodactyl/cradily,armaldo,milotic t3* to place a 3 token bid on that match.

During the break each match is assigned a codename and displayed on-stream.  If you spot a match you want to see, you can boost it with your own tokens.

**Boost a displayed match** by typing: */w tpp match [codename] t[amount]*

* The match with the most tokens will be played on the hour
* If you are outbid, your tokens will be returned to you
