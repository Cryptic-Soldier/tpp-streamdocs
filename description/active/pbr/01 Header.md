In **Twitch Plays Pokémon** (**TPP**), you can bet on and influence matches of **Pokémon Battle Revolution** (**PBR**) in chat!

You have two currencies:

**PokéYen** - virtual currency, used to bet on Pokémon matches

**Tokens** - virtual currency, based on stream donations, subscriptions, give-aways, and [PBR avatar creation](https://twitchplayspokemon.tv/avatars).

PBR has four main phases: **Betting Phase**, **Match Phase**, **Results Phase** and **Sidegame**

***Note:** TPP collects and uses some data about your Twitch account so you can play. Find out what data we collect, how we collect it, and what we use it for by reading our privacy statement [here](https://github.com/TwitchPlaysPokemon/tpp-streamdocs/blob/master/privacy/privacy-statement.md).*
