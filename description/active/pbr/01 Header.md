In **Twitch Plays Pokémon** \(**TPP**\), you can bet on and influence matches of **Pokémon Battle Revolution** \(**PBR**\) in chat!

You have two currencies:

**PokéYen** - virtual currency, used to bet on Pokémon matches

**Tokens** - virtual currency, based on stream donations, subscriptions, give-aways, and [PBR avatar creation](https://twitchplayspokemon.tv/avatars).

PBR has four main phases: **Betting Phase**, **Match Phase**, **Results Phase** and **Sidegame**

Several times a week, there'll be live commentary. [**See the PBR Live Commentary Schedule here.**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r?cid=Z2prZzl1bHE4anFjaG5hZmJpNTR1bnVxa3NAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)
