## Commands
- *up, down, left, right*
- *a* (enter levels) *b* (wait)
- *undo, restart, start*

**Democracy**:
- *restart* and *start* are only available in Democracy
- *Democracy* is activated by 50% of votes
- You can input multiple commands in Democracy in a single input. For example, *downlefta* would input the commands *down, left,* then *a.*

**Tips**:
- Commands are not case sensitive - you can mix it up! For example, *sEleCt* will have the same effect as *select*.
- You can also use compass directions in replacement of regular directions: *n, e, s, w*
- Just want to farm experience to level up (*/w tpp level*)? Use: *exp, xp,* or *p*
