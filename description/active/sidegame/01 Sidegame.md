During seasons, a game will be played on the side (the "sidegame").

**Current game:** Pok√©mon Sweet

Type into the chat box and press Enter to control the game.

Available commands: *up, down, left, right, a, b, start, select, L, R*

* Enter one command per match
* Each command is voted on
* The command with the most votes will be input into the game
* You can also whisper commands during battles with */w sidegame [command]*

**Want your command to win?** Place a token bribe with */w tpp bribe [command]*

**Feeling generous?** Put your tokens in the reward pot for sideagames and make it a token storm with */w tpp storm t[number of tokens]*

**Tip:** Commands are not case sensitive - trying mixing it up!

For example, typing *sEleCt* will have the same effect as *select*.
