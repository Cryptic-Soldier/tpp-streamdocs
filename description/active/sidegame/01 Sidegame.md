Between matches, a game will be played on the side (the "sidegame").

Type a command in the chat box and press Enter to help control the game.

Available commands: *up, down, left, right, a, b, start, select, L, R*

* Players may input one command during the countdown
* Players may change their command during the countdown
* When the countdown ends, the game plays the command with the most votes
* Inputting players have a chance to win tokens from the Token Pool

**Want your command to win?** Place a token bribe with */w tpp bribe [command]*

**Feeling generous?** Make a "token storm"! Contribute your tokens to the Token Pool with */w tpp storm t[number of tokens]*

**Tip:** Commands are not case sensitive - typing *sEleCt* will have the same effect as *select*.
