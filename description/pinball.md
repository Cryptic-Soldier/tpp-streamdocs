Tokens can be gambled on Pokémon Pinball. Flippers are activated automatically. The payout is calculated based on the score; the more points, the higher the payout. The amount needed for each multiple is displayed below.

* Red Table: 38,000,000 points per payout multiplier
* Blue Table: 52,000,000 points per payout multiplier

The number of points is set so that each table will have a payback percentage of approximately 100% over time.

Pokémon being captured or evolved results in a badge of that Pokémon being randomly distributed to a user in chat.

The command to start Pokemon Pinball is `/w tpp pinball t<amount>`. For example: `/w tpp pinball t1` would bet 1 token on the outcome of a game of Pokémon Pinball played on the red or blue table, depending on which table is currently being played. You can check which table is next with `/w tpp pinball`.

If the stream goes down during a game of Pokémon Pinball, bet token(s) will be refunded automatically but there will be no payout regardless of score.
