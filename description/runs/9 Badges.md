Badges are miniature Pokémon to display next to your name on the stream.  Collect them during runs or Pokémon Pinball!

* When a Pokémon species is caught in game, its badge will be awarded
* If you've inputted in the last 30 minutes, you'll be eligible to win
* Each species is awarded only once - repeat catches are not awarded!
