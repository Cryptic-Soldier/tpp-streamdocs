On special occasions, Twitch Plays Pok√©mon will switch to Democracy mode!

In this mode, you can also combine several commands at once just by typing them without spaces.  The command combination will be input sequentially into the game.

So, if you wanted to press start, move down twice and press A, you would type: *startdown2a*

* All players vote on each command
* The command with the most votes is input into the game
* Each command is input every 30 seconds
* Input the same commands as usual
* Use the *wait* command to leave a gap between combinations
* Combine up to 9 commands at once (i.e. total commands must add up to 9 or less)

Look out for and take advantage of Democracy mode in special locations and in-game events!
