At the end of a PBR season, rewards are given based on a playerâ€™s final rank and balance. These rewards are stored in your inventory. Use `/w tpp inventory` to show your items and their corresponding item id, and then use `/w tpp useitem <id>` to use an item. Items can vary, but include:

* Crates (various tiers): can occasionally be empty, but typically contains badges, tokens, or the other items listed below. When using a crate, the overlay will display an animation of a crate opening.
* Noise Maker: allows people to play the cry of their currently equipped badge on stream
* Mail: allows people to show a message on stream (similar to donations)
* Emote Rain: allows people to drop some emotes on stream (similar to donations, except you must be subscribed to a channel to use its sub emotes)
* Chatter: allows people to text-to-speech on stream a random message from chat
The aforementioned items can also be rewarded from Cheerful Slots.

# Cheerful Slots

The number of bits used in Cheers is tracked, and for every 100 bits (can be from multiple cheers from multiple people) cheered in total, the Cheerful Slots are played.
Cheerful Slots determine prizes which are then rewarded to random people in chat and put in their inventory.

# Bit badges

By donating Twitch bits to the stream in chat using cheer commands, you can obtain a bit badge on the stream showing what major amount of bits you have donated.
