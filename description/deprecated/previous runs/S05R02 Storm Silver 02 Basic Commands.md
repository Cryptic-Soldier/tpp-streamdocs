Commands correspond to the buttons on the console.  Type into the chat box and press Enter to control the game.

Available commands: *up, down, left, right, a, b, x, y, l, r start, select*

**Tip:** Commands are not case sensitive - trying mixing it up!

For example, typing *sEleCt* will have the same effect as *select*.

**Advanced Tip:** You can also use compass directions for precise movement: *n, e, s, w*

Just want to farm some points?  Use: *exp*, *xp* or *p*
