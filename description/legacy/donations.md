You can donate to the Twitch Plays Pokemon channel using [Streamtip: https://streamtip.com/t/twitchplayspokemon](https://streamtip.com/t/twitchplayspokemon).

Thank you for all your donations! It pays for the great hardware that allows TPP to be a 1080p60 stream, and for great programmers so TPP can play awesome and functional romhacks, and for more.

### Tokens

For each $1 USD donated you'll receive 1 token. However, if you donate the highest amount of a certain timespan (i.e. within the past six hours), you will get additional tokens for breaking donation records. Tokens can be used for the following:

* Bidding to hear specific songs
* Making specific matches
* Betting on matches
* Buying and selling Pok√©mon badges
* Bribing users to vote on a specific sidegame input
* Creating "storms" in which tokens are given away to others
* Unlocking a secondary username color

You can also earn tokens by subscribing. A subscription costs $5 and gets you 5 tokens per month + amount of months subscribed (up to 15 months), in addition to other benefits, so it's a better value than just a $5 donation.

### Message

You can add a message to your donation and it will be displayed on the stream. All donation amounts will have their message displayed.

If you send abusive or offensive messages, you risk having all your messages blocked in the future.

Emotes included in the message will drop from the top of the overlay and bounce around. You can use emotes from any channel on Twitch, even if you're not subscribed to them.

### Username

Streamtip allows any username to be chosen.

In order to receive tokens you **must** use the same username as on Twitch. However, by signing in to Streamtip and linking your Twitch account, you can donate under any username and still receive the tokens.

Anyone who breaks donation records will have their username shown on stream until that record is broken again.

### Large donator badges

Users who have donated over $200 cumulatively across all donations get a golden `$` symbol next to their username on the overlay.
