During runs and matches a game will be played "on the side" known as a sidegame. Currently Pok√©mon Bootleg Green is the sidegame being played. A screenshot progression of the game will be linked soon.

The button to input is decided with a vote. To vote on a button use this command: `/w tpp sidegame <button>`, for example: `/w tpp sidegame a` would cast a vote for the A button. You can also type the command into chat to input during the allotted inputting period, which is the 60 second countdown where the sidegame is full screen.

### Bribes

It is possible to allocate tokens to bribe voters of a certain button. Use the `/w tpp bribe <button> t<tokens>` command, for example: `/w tpp bribe a t5` would allocate 5 tokens to be evenly distributed to people who vote on the `a` button.

Bribes are distributed regardless of if the button wins or not. They can also be made outside of the 60 second inputting period using whispers.
