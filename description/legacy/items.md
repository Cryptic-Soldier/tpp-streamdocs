# Items

You have an inventory that can contain things like crates (rewards after seasonal resets) or various consumables and
collectables. To check your inventory, use the `/w tpp inventory` command. To use an item, use `/w tpp useitem number`.
Most items have a notification or animation that gets queued up and shown on stream, for example opening a crate. 

Items will be tradeable in the future, though that feature is not done yet unfortunately.
